    "#Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree classifier is a  machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the feature space into smaller regions based on the values of input features. At each step, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into distinct classes such as into yes and No, aiming to minimize  gini impurity or maximize information gain. This process continues until the algorithm gets sufficient homogeneous data. To make predictions, the decision tree traverses the tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the values of input features, and assigns the majority class in that leaf node to the input instance."

For instance, precision is important when the False positive penalty is high, while recall is critical when the false negatives penalty is high. F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall. Other metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and specificity may also be relevant."
